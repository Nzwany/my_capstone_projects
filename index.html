        <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
        <p>I have a creative flair which exhibits itself in my work, hobbies and skills. I am committed to delivering excellence in everything I do. I love Technology, Innovation, Design, Project Management, Writing and the Culinary Arts. I am passionate about design and believe everything we do is an opportunity to display design qualities, whether it be the artful use of words, plating food, putting together an outfit or designing the interior of one’s home.
           I am a multi-skilled individual who believes everything should be approached with a touch of design excellence, creativity, problem-solving and value-creation. My educational background is in architectural design, project management and real estate. These are the stepping stones that shaped my skillset and catapulted me into the world of technology. Owing to my passion for technology, I have carved a niche for myself in a space that ties all my passions and pursuits together to create value.
           Against this backdrop, I have orchestrated multiple projects and desire to achieve greater goals as a full-stack software engineer.</p>
